 options, a scheduling system, a queueing system to manage no-shows, and a
 rescheduling feature with validation controls. Additionally, an announcement
 panel, events section, and documents repository facilitate seamless infor

 yielded a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 88.75 , indicating an above
average and excellent user experience for the developed system
